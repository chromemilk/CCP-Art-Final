1|Hall of Bulls|Unknown|15,000 BCE|Prehistory|Cave Painting|Lascaux Cave, France|The Hall of Bulls Paleolithic cave painting. The Hall of Bulls is a colossal piece of cave art that showcases the likes of bulls, horses, and deer on the walls and ceiling of the limestone. Each animal has natural, curvy features —- indicating nature-centric art and visual story telling. It is theorized that the abundance and scale of the works may have held a spiritual or ritualistic function in the absence of complex verbal or written communication.|This cave painting showcases early visual storytelling. With common written language being rare, or incomplete, this form of communication dominated pre-historic storytelling. It also shows collective identity among people as they passed information down. The labyrinth structure and depth of the cave serves to prove this theory with many skilled artists each with their own mark —- their paintings.|I believe that the most prominent theme of these paintings, and the cave itself is the sense of community. It is clear that it took many people over the course of an extended period of time to create the identity that the cave has today. The use of observations of the natural world, combined with the sense of vitality indicates a strong community with a distinct form of narration. More compelling, however, is the idea that this was a novel attempt at information and communal permanence, showing how humans had the ability to reason and band together over a period of time to convey complex ideas.|bulls.bmp|7.0|14.0
