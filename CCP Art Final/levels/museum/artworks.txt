1|Hall of Bulls|Unknown|15,000 BCE|Prehistory|Carved Ivory|Lascaux Cave, France|The Hall of Bulls is a cave painting from the Paleolithic Era (Old-Stone Era) located in Lascaux, France. The Hall of Bulls is a colossal piece of cave art that showcases the likes of bulls, horses, and deer on the walls and ceiling of the limestone. Each animal can be seen with natural, curvy features —- indicating one of the earliest examples of nature-centric art and visual story telling. The compositions can be viewed as actionable, with movement prevalent among all the featured animals. It is theorized that the abundance and scale of the works may have held a spiritual or ritualistic function in the absence of complex verbal or written communication.|This cave painting serves as a testament to the world of visual storytelling. With common written language being rare, or incomplete, this form of communication dominated pre-historic storytelling. Beyond that, it also highlights the idea of a collective identity among people as they passed information down. The labyrinth structure and depth of the cave serves to prove this theory with many skilled artists each with their own mark —- their paintings.|I believe that the most prominent theme of these paintings, and the cave itself is the sense of community. It is clear that it took many people over the course of an extended period of time to create the identity that the cave has today. The use of observations of the natural world, combined with the sense of vitality indicates a strong community with a distinct form of narration. More compelling, however, is the idea that this was a novel attempt at information and communal permanence, showing how humans had the ability to reason and band together over a period of time to convey complex ideas.|bulls.bmp|2.5|1.4
