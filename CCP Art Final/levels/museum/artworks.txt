1|Hall of Bulls|Unknown Paleolithic artists|15,000 BCE|Upper Paleolithic|Pigment on limestone|Lascaux Cave, France|A colossal Paleolithic painting in Lascaux, France, showing bulls, horses, and deer. The dynamic, natural forms suggest early visual storytelling, possibly for ritual use. Fun fact: One of the bulls is 5.2 meters (17 ft) long, the largest animal yet found in cave art.|This art serves as a testament to pre-historic visual storytelling before complex language and highlights a collective identity, as many artists likely contributed over time.|I believe that the most prominent theme of these paintings, and the cave itself is the sense of community. It is clear that it took many people over the course of an extended period of time to create the identity that the cave has today. The use of observations of the natural world, combined with the sense of vitality indicates a strong community with a distinct form of narration. More compelling, however, is the idea that this was a novel attempt at information and communal permanence, showing how humans had the ability to reason and band together over a period of time to convey complex ideas.|bulls.bmp|7.0|14.0

2|Human with Feline Head|Unknown Aurignacian artist|40,000 - 35,000 BCE|Upper Paleolithic|Mammoth ivory|Hohlenstein-Stadel, Germany|A nearly 1-foot-tall figurine from mammoth ivory depicting a human-feline hybrid. Its mythical nature suggests it was a storytelling device. Fun fact: Found in fragments in 1939, it's one of the oldest-known sculptures, taking an estimated 350+ hours to carve.|This is one of the earliest examples of imaginative storytelling and abstract reasoning, indicating a spiritual or religious belief system that predates complex language.|I think this piece is interesting because it showcases the rawest form of imagination —- one without reference. It tells me that even early humans had the capacity to be imaginative and create something abstract that still had inherent cultural and spiritual weight. The piece serves as a predecessor to what would be known as divine association despite its creator not understanding formal religion.|feline.bmp|7.0|12.0

3|Mastabas|Ancient Egyptian architects|3000 - 2600 BCE|Early Dynastic Period / Old Kingdom|Mudbricks and limestone|Egypt|Early rectangular tombs for Egyptian elites with flat roofs and plain exteriors. The interiors, however, were elaborately decorated with art and offerings for the afterlife. Fun fact: The name "mastaba" is Arabic for "stone bench," which the structures resemble.|They show the evolution of burial practices and the strong cultural belief in an eternal afterlife, where the dead needed their material belongings.|Mastabas remind me of veneers, but the opposite. Veneers attempt to hide ugliness through a pretty outside. While, on the other hand, mastabas seem plain at a glance, once you get inside you see the beauty of the full power of loyal artists and religious devotion. It depicts life as continuous rather than discrete, and that belief pushed rulers to create a legacy, something worth living for, as well as to be proud to die for.|mastaba.bmp|7.0|10.0

4|Abu Simbel|Ancient Egyptian architects (commissioned by Ramses II)|1264 - 1244 BCE|New Kingdom, 19th Dynasty|Sandstone (rock-cut)|Nubia, Egypt|A colossal temple (98 ft high, 115 ft wide) carved into a sandstone cliff, featuring four statues of Ramses II. Fun fact: In the 1960s, the entire temple was meticulously cut, moved, and reassembled to save it from the rising waters of Lake Nasser.|The temple uses art to convey political authority, family, and divinity. The massive, precise reconstruction effort highlights its timeless importance.|I really like this one because of the preservation effort made throughout the years (it started in 1892 and ended in 1968, that’s a 76 year project!) This represents permanence to me, and the idea that humans will go above and beyond just to keep history alive is powerful. The fact that today, after a near total reconstruction, light still hits the same chambers the same exact way it did thousands of years ago is wild.|ramses.bmp|7.0|8.0

5|Stonehenge|Unknown Neolithic peoples|2550 - 1600 BCE|Neolithic / Bronze Age|Sarsen and bluestone|Salisbury Plain, England|A monumental circle of 13-foot-high stones using post-and-lintel construction. It is aligned with the solstices and also served as a major burial ground. Fun fact: The smaller bluestones were transported over 150 miles from Wales.|This monument is able to tie together multiple aspects of the human condition through time, nature, and the collective goal of understanding the natural world.|The fact that its idea of how the universe works still holds up today further reinforces my belief that the instinct to learn is what unites people —- even from vastly different backgrounds. It is impactful that a seemingly insignificant arrangement of stones can carry significant weight and meaning pertaining to how humans as a species learn and persevere.|stonehenge.bmp|5.0|14.0
